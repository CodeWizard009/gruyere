This page is for emergency purpose if I get a Backlog in NS. 

Question paper format : 50 marks 
Weight distribution : 
Either 4Q X 10M = 40M + 10M viva = 50M
Or 1Q X 10M + 2Q X 15M + 10M viva = 50M 

Q1) Find the ip address from the subnet id on which the metasploitable server is hosted. 
Given subnet : 172.17.19.0/24 
172.17.19.200-254 (after sometime the range was shortened to reduce the difficiulty) 
Final answer was 172.17.19.222 
nmap -sv (sV) 172.17.19.222 
nmap -p- -sV 172.17.19.0/24
Q2) Enumeration 
Q3) Vulnerabilities finding and exploitation 
Q4) Report : create a word document and paste SS of commands performed on kali terminal.
Q5) Viva: learn about enum outputs and metasploitable Vulnerabilities. 

☆ On answers sheet write all the steps of Q1 & Q2 like 1st cmd it's output then 2nd cmd it's output .... how you found the metasploitable server. For 2nd Q write all the enum cmds and it's outputs. 
Q3) What Vulnerabilities you found? Cmds, names, how you exploited 

Vasu's answer : 
Q1) nmap -sn 172.17.19.0/24 (subnet id)
This will give all the active ip addresses in that subnet. 
nmap -Pn <individual active ip> 
(also comes under enumeration)
Enter all the active ip's 1 by 1 and check for open ports. 
Enter all the active ips 1 by 1 on chrome's address bar (without https://) and check if it metasploitable server opens, that will be the correct ip address among the subnet. 

Q2) Enumeration of ip address 
a) nmap -sSV <ip>

The command nmap -sSV <ip> performs a detailed scan on the target IP address to discover open ports, identify services running on those ports, and determine the version of each service.(172.17.19.222) 

b) enum4linux <ip> 

What enum4linux Collects

Usernames and Groups: Lists local users and group memberships.

Shares: Displays shared folders or drives on the server.

OS Information: Attempts to identify the target system’s OS.

Password Policies: Retrieves policies such as password length and complexity requirements.

Network Configurations: Tries to identify the domain and workgroup of the target.

Other Information: Depending on the permissions available, it may also retrieve additional information about the system or domain.

c) nmap -O <target-ip>

This command attempts to detect the operating system of the target by analyzing the responses from the scanned ports. This can give you more insight into the target system.

d) nmap --script=default <target-ip>
This runs a series of default Nmap scripts designed for general enumeration (e.g., service discovery, vulnerability detection, etc.).

netcat cmds 

Q3) Finding web and network vulnerabilities.
a) Web vulnerabilities: 
Ctrl+shift+C or Right click & inspect 
Go to network tab 
Refresh this tab 
Find a file whose name is same as the name of website
Go to response tab 
Go to headers 
Find missing headers and unupdated versions (learn about security headers, how to find vulnerabilities by looking/checking at the headers) 
Website : securityheaders.com (not useful in exam) 
Example open server: the name of the server was directly visible. 

b) Network vulnerabilities: 
nmap --script=vuln <ip> 
Gives list of vulnerabilities, find and exploit 4 of these (can be used in enum) 

For telnet vulnerabilities: telnet <ip> 
In the output you'll get login and password use it to connect telnet server. 
ftp vulnerabilities? 

How to use burpsuite? Request capturing and ctrl+R (repeater) 
Check for common network vulnerabilities and how to exploit them. 

Shaunak's answer: 

1) Finding server: 
-> nmap -sn <subnet ip>
Gives live ips in the subnet 
(mostly 4 or 5 live ips) 

nmap -F <ip> 
nmap -Pn <ip> 
Above 2 cmds checks the open ports of the given ip, by which we can see which ip is most vulnerable. 

Check each ip on chrome and check which one contains the server.

2) Enumeration: 
-> nmap -sV <ip>
nmap -A <ip>
nmap -sC <ip>
nmap -p 22,80,443 <ip>
scans the specified ports
nmap -p- <ip>
scans all the 65,535 ports
